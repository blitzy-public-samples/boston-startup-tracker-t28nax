[pytest]
# Set verbose output and enable coverage reporting
addopts = -v --cov=src/backend --cov-report=term-missing

# Specify the directory where test files are located
testpaths = tests/backend

# Define the pattern for test file names
python_files = test_*.py

# Define the pattern for test function names
python_functions = test_*

# Define custom markers for different types of tests
markers =
    unit: marks unit tests
    integration: marks integration tests
    slow: marks slow tests

# Human tasks (for review and future updates):
# - Review and adjust the coverage settings based on project requirements
# - Consider adding more specific markers for different types of tests
# - Verify that the testpaths correctly point to all your test directories
# - Consider adding configuration for test result caching to speed up test runs
# - Add any project-specific pytest plugins to the configuration
# - Review and update the python_files and python_functions patterns if needed
# - Consider adding configuration for parallel test execution if applicable
# - Add any environment variables needed for testing
# - Consider configuring pytest to generate XML reports for CI integration
# - Regularly review and update pytest and its plugins to leverage new features
