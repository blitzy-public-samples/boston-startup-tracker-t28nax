## DATABASE DESIGN

The Boston Startup Tracker will use PostgreSQL as its primary database management system. The database design will follow a relational model to efficiently store and manage startup data. Here's an overview of the main tables and their relationships:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    STARTUP {
        int id PK
        string name
        string website
        string industry
        string sub_sector
        int employee_count
        int local_employee_count
        float headcount_growth_rate
        float total_funding

    STARTUP ||--o{ JOB_POSTING : offers
    STARTUP ||--o{ NEWS_ARTICLE : mentioned_in
    FUNDING_ROUND }o--o{ INVESTOR : participates_in
```

This design allows for efficient querying and relationship management between different entities within the Boston startup ecosystem.

## API DESIGN

The Boston Startup Tracker will implement a RESTful API to facilitate communication between the frontend application and the backend services, as well as to provide data access to external systems. The API will be built using Python Flask and will follow these design principles:

1. Use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
2. Stateless communication
3. Proper use of HTTP status codes
4. JSON for data exchange
5. Versioning to ensure backward compatibility

Here's an overview of the main API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/startups` | GET | Retrieve a list of startups (with pagination) |
| `/api/v1/startups/<id>` | GET | Retrieve details of a specific startup |
| `/api/v1/startups/search` | GET | Search startups based on various criteria |
| `/api/v1/investors` | GET | Retrieve a list of investors |
| `/api/v1/investors/<id>` | GET | Retrieve details of a specific investor |
| `/api/v1/jobs` | GET | Retrieve a list of job postings |
| `/api/v1/news` | GET | Retrieve recent news articles |
| `/api/v1/users` | POST | Create a new user account |
| `/api/v1/users/<id>` | GET, PUT | Retrieve or update user information |
| `/api/v1/auth/login` | POST | Authenticate user and receive access token |
| `/api/v1/auth/logout` | POST | Invalidate user's access token |

Authentication will be implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access to protected endpoints.

## USER INTERFACE DESIGN
