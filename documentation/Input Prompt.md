I am hoping to build a Boston Startup Tracker. This will be a list of all "active" venture backed companies with Boston HQs that have raised institutional money in the past 5 years and have enriched data so a wider audience can see what they're up to. It will have the company name and website and will crawl active data across public sources to aggregate the following.. Company Name Industry "What it does" based on company website or public description Sub-sector if relevant (depending on data source) Number of employees Number of employees locally Headcount growth last 12 months Amount Fundraised Last Fundraise Amount Fundraise Stage Investors Hiring? Yes/No Founder(s) Executives Roles Available Most recent news Bonus: Employee count by department / Competitors / Site Traffic / Revenue / Tech Stack
