# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Boston Startup Tracker is a comprehensive digital platform designed to provide real-time, enriched data on active venture-backed companies headquartered in Boston. This solution addresses the need for a centralized, up-to-date resource that offers insights into the vibrant Boston startup ecosystem. By aggregating and presenting crucial information from various public sources, the tracker will serve as an invaluable tool for investors, job seekers, researchers, and industry analysts.

## OBJECTIVES

1. Create a user-friendly database of Boston-based startups that have raised institutional funding within the past five years.
2. Aggregate and display key company information, including:
   - Company details (name, website, industry, sub-sector)
   - Funding information (total raised, last round, stage, investors)
   - Employee data (total count, local count, growth rate)
   - Leadership team (founders, executives)
   - Current hiring status and available roles
   - Recent news and developments
3. Implement automated data crawling and updating mechanisms to ensure information accuracy and timeliness.
4. Provide a platform for users to easily search, filter, and analyze Boston's startup landscape.

### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Budget Risks] --> B[Data Source Changes]
    A --> C[Scope Creep]
    A --> D[Infrastructure Costs]
    A --> E[Legal Compliance]
    A --> F[Extended Development Time]

    D --> I[Mitigation: Scalable Architecture and Reserved Instances]
    E --> J[Mitigation: Ongoing Legal Consultation]
    F --> K[Mitigation: Agile Methodology and Buffer Time]
```

1. **Data Source Changes**: The project relies heavily on public data sources. If these sources change their structure or access policies, it could require additional development work.
   - Mitigation: Design a flexible data aggregation system that can adapt to changes with minimal rework.

2. **Scope Creep**: As the project progresses, there may be requests for additional features or data points.
   - Mitigation: Implement a strict change control process and clearly define the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to avoid unnecessary expansions.

3. **Infrastructure Costs**: As the user base grows, cloud infrastructure costs may increase more rapidly than anticipated.
   - Mitigation: Design a scalable architecture and utilize reserved instances to optimize costs. Regularly review and optimize resource usage.

4. **Legal Compliance**: Changes in data protection laws or regulations may require additional legal consultation and system modifications.
   - Mitigation: Allocate budget for ongoing legal consultation and design the system with privacy and compliance in mind from the start.

5. **Extended Development Time**: Unforeseen technical challenges could extend the development timeline.
   - Mitigation: Use an Agile development methodology to adapt to changes quickly. Include buffer time in the project schedule and budget.

6. **Third-Party API Costs**: If usage of third-party APIs exceeds initial estimates, costs could increase.
   - Mitigation: Implement usage monitoring and set up alerts for approaching limits. Have contingency plans for alternative data sources or features.

7. **Currency Fluctuations**: For any international services or team members, currency exchange rate changes could impact the budget.
   - Mitigation: Consider using forward contracts or setting aside a small buffer for potential exchange rate fluctuations.

8. **Talent Retention**: Losing key team members could result in additional costs for hiring and onboarding replacements.
   - Mitigation: Include competitive compensation and engagement strategies in the budget to retain top talent throughout the project.

By carefully monitoring these potential risk areas and implementing the proposed mitigation strategies, we aim to keep the project within budget while delivering a high-quality Boston Startup Tracker. Regular budget reviews and stakeholder communications will be conducted to ensure transparency and allow for timely adjustments if needed.
