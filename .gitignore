# Human tasks:
# - Review and update the .gitignore file periodically to ensure it reflects the current project structure and tools used
# - Consider adding patterns for any new development tools or build outputs introduced to the project
# - Ensure that no sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) is accidentally committed to the repository
# - Verify that all necessary files for the application to run are not being inadvertently ignored
# - Consider using a tool like gitignore.io to generate comprehensive .gitignore files for specific tech stacks
